Our goal is to make a software that uses fibonacci sequences and prime numbers to generate music through asking the user what tempo, key signature, and time signature they want.

Python code
1. create a function to generate a sequence of first 10 prime numbers
2. create a function to generate a sequence of first 10 Fibonacci series numbers
3. create a function to generate a sequence of first 10 Multiple of 2s numbers
4. create a function to generate a sequence of first 10  Multiple of 5s numbers
5. create a function to generate midi files. Send the above sequence, filename and tempo number (480) to this function
	- basically with for loop match each number in sequence with a scale to create a note
	- then append that note to the track
	- after the loop, save the midi file with your filename.

Run instructions: 

1. Open the command prompt and type in "pip install mido".
2. Stay in the command prompyt and type in "pip install music21".
3. Go to https://streamlit.io/ and follow the download instructions.
4. Once downloaded, run the program and copy the path given (e.g., streamlit run C:\Science_Fair\Mathematical-Melodies\Mathematical_Melodies.py). It will be the line under the yellow Warning
5. Open the command prompt and paste the path.
